This timing is essential for properly cooking the rice and ensuring that the flavors meld together.\n\n3. **Resting Time**: After removing from heat, the dish should be left for a further **10 minutes with the lid on**. This resting period is important for allowing the rice to finish cooking and absorb the flavors.\n\nThese specific details are critical for achieving the desired outcome of the dish and would be difficult to generate accurately without the recipe.",
