    "query": "I want to make a cherry pie, but I'm not sure how to get the crust just right. Do I need to do anything special with the top crust before baking, and how long should I cook the filling to make sure it's the right thickness?",
    "salient_fact": "Based on the provided cherry pie recipe, here are two specific technical details that would be difficult to generate from scratch but are clearly outlined in the recipe:\n\n1. **Specific Cooking Techniques/Methods**: \n   - \"Poke holes with a fork into the top of the crust\" - This detail specifies a technique used to allow steam to escape during baking, which is crucial for achieving the right texture in the pie crust.\n\n2. **Timing Specifics**: \n   - \"Simmer for 5 min, still stirring\" - This precise timing is important for achieving the right consistency of the filling, ensuring that the sauce thickens properly before adding the cherries.\n\nThese details are essential for successfully executing the recipe and would likely be sought after by someone looking to replicate the dish accurately.",
