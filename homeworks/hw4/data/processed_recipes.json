    "description": "a translucent golden-brown crust allows the green of the avocado to be seen. the crispy exterior is a counterpoint to the unctuous interior. these are a signature dish for me, and the one i most often get requests to make (although my seafood and ricotta stuffed buckwheat pancakes run a close second). these fritters came about ten years ago when i was shopping for a dinner i was making for a friend who is a cia-trained chef. i was in a vegetable market and saw these gorgeous avocados that i just knew would be ripe in the next two days. i tried to think of what i could do with them since a) everyone serves cold avocado, and b) i really am not fond of guacamole. as i tried to think of what i could make with them that was hot, the work 'fritters' jumped into my head. having never made a fritter before, i was a little surprised to have that thought; but having never known when a vegetable was going to be ripe before i figured i was on a roll and decided to go for it. to serve with my never-before-tried-fritters, i decided to make a crème fraîche-lime-cayenne dipping sauce. so i made fresh crème fraîche, and used it as a base not only for this dip, but for a tia maria sauce to go with the flourless chocolate cake i made for dessert (another never-before made item, but with the recipe from cook's illustrated it was the only thing i wasn't making up as i went along). the result of the fritters was that i got to taste the test fritter, then had to dive across the couch before the last one was devoured in order to have a second. the one evolution in the recipe is the change from cayenne to chipotle in the dip. i like the smokiness, and it gives a rough edge to something very smooth - i am all about contrast. feel free to use whatever chile or combination thereof that you like best. this dip is easy and stands on it's own at a party for anything you want to dip into it. i have also made it with vegan sour cream with great results. the name alligator claws comes from an alternate name for the avocado: the alligator pear, as well as the fact that the wedges of avocado look like claws. (for those not familiar with the name alligator pear, it derives from both the tough, textured exterior - reminiscent of an alligator's hide, and the fact that you really can't eat one until it softens - just like a pear.) alligator claws are also a great name to call them if you have kids who either won't eat anything that sounds weird and you want to keep them to yourself, or - if you want your kids to eat them - if you have kids who'll only eat things that will gross other people out. if you are preparing these for kids (and i recommend you do whatever name you choose to call them), protect their palates and tone down the heat of the sauce. maybe skip the chiles altogether and put in just a hint of finely ground pepper (white pepper won't look like black specks throughout the dip - i'm normally not that fussy, but it's something kids will notice). allow half an avocado per person. this is so rich that more is too much. note: you can easily cut the recipe in half, all the batter is is a one-to-one mix of flour & water (someone has suggested trying tempura batter which comes in a mix at many supermarkets - i tend to be a from-scratch kind of guy. or do i just mean itchy?). enjoy. -- text by michael david winter, aka the poker roach",

(for those not familiar with the name alligator pear, it derives from both the tough, textured exterior - reminiscent of an alligator's hide, and the fact that you really can't eat one until it softens - just like a pear.) alligator claws are also a great name to call them if you have kids who either won't eat anything that sounds weird and you want to keep them to yourself, or - if you want your kids to eat them - if you have kids who'll only eat things that will gross other people out. if you are preparing these for kids (and i recommend you do whatever name you choose to call them), protect their palates and tone down the heat of the sauce. maybe skip the chiles altogether and put in just a hint of finely ground pepper (white pepper won't look like black specks throughout the dip - i'm normally not that fussy, but it's something kids will notice). allow half an avocado per person. this is so rich that more is too much. note: you can easily cut the recipe in half, all the batter is is a one-to-one mix of flour & water (someone has suggested trying tempura batter which comes in a mix at many supermarkets - i tend to be a from-scratch kind of guy. or do i just mean itchy?). enjoy. -- text by michael david winter, aka the poker roach creme fraiche lime, zest of lime, juice of ground chipotle chile pepper flour water hass avocadoes olive oil salt dip: put the crme frache into a medium-sized mixing bowl zest the lime finely and mix the zest into the crme frache roll the lime on your counter , placing enough pressure to soften the pulp inside without breaking the lime's skin cut the lime in half and squeeze the juice from one half , reserving the other half for another use while stirring , slowly add the juice to the crme frache until you get a consistency just the runny side of mayonnaise add a couple of pinches of ground chipotle , stir in and taste , repeating until you have both a heat and smokiness you like if you are making this a day or two ahead of time , stop adding the chile when you are just shy of how strong you think you'd like it to be it will get stronger overnight fritters: mix the flour & water in a medium-sized bowl until absolutely smooth put a heavy-weight frying pan on the stove on medium heat and put a paper towel lined plate nearby halve an avocado from top to bottom twist to remove section from pit , then remove the pit from the other half cut each half into four wedges and remove the skin add oil to the pan dip each section of avocado into the batter , leaving only a very thin layer of batter on each , and add the wedges to the pan one at a time as you batter them by the lime the last is in , it will be time to turn the first cook each side until golden brown when done , place each fritter on the towel-lined plate to remove excess oil sprinkle a little salt over the fritters , plate and serve hot with dipping sauce 60-minutes-or-less time-to-make course main-ingredient cuisine preparation occasion north-american appetizers lunch snacks vegetables american mexican southwestern-united-states easy beginner-cook dinner-party finger-food vegetarian dips dietary inexpensive presentation served-hot"

      "with cold water it will need 3-4 hours",
      "add the yeast to the water in a 5 quart bowl or , preferably , in a resealable , lidded plastic food container or food-grade bucket",
      "don't worry about getting it all to dissolve",

      "mix with a wooden spoon , a high-capacity food processor fitted with the dough attachment , or a heavy duty stand mixer fitted with the dough hook until the mixture is uniform",
      "if you're hand mixing and it becomes too difficult to incorporate all the flour with the spoon , you can reach into your mixing vessel with very wet hands and press the mixture together",
      "don't knead , it isn't necessary",

      "allow the mixture to rise at room temperature until it begins to collapse , approx 2 hours , depending on room temperature , and initial water temperature longer rising times , up to 5 hours , won't harm the result",

      "most of the dusting flour will fall off - that's fine , it isn't meant to be incorporated",

      "rest the loaf and let it rise in the form , on the tray / pizza peel , for about 40 minutes depending on the age of the dough , you may not see much rise during this period",

    "description": "please note: the words \"kale moti\" refer to the small grains of black urad dal. 'kale' here is a hindi(indian) word for black colour which happens to be the colour the lentils used in this recipe. 'moti' means pearls...what this means here is that this rice dish is a treat of black lentils and is as delicious as pearls are beautiful. 'kale' here does not refer to any kind of cabbage. have a spoon of this and you'll want to come and hug me, kiss me, probably even marry me for sharing this:) i got this recipe from the 'thursday' magazine (contributed by manisha nanda, and she got 50 us dollars as prize money for this!), but, slightly tweaked it, to make it on the spicy side. it's not too spicy, its just great! the original recipe is on a sweeter side(more yogurt and some milk as well). i am absolutely head over heels crazy about this biryani. it's vegetarian, a complete meal in itself, finger food(oh yes - you must eat it with your fingers to relish every grain of this dish that is absolutely priceless, its so tasty that i'd personally keep giving it stars till i dropped dead:) not a bad idea to take a plate of this to your girlfriend if she loves rice and is cross with you, she'll jump up and marry you, oh yeah, i bet she will :) try it! :) this is one dish i really really love, inspite of the butter and rice(both which make a man fat), this one's just perfect to have once in a while, when your just sitting on that bubble of \"i reached my goal\" or even if you need something to inspire you to do something, try this dish. not only will you see sweet dreams the night you make it, oh, you will be filled with a magical charisma! if i could, i would love to donate plates filled with this to every poor man, woman and child alive on the planet. i really really love this dish with my mind, body and soul :) have it for your diwali lunch/dinner party(with just 4 days to go before the festival day, you know what's going to be cooking at my end!), your birthday party(attn: troy- i'm thinking nov 1st and of you- happy birthday a day in advance!), your new year party(just 60 days left for 2002 to end!), your wedding anniversary, any time when you want to have a treat, and enjoy the food of a king, go for this! i'm dedicating this recipe to troy hakala as i know from his 'about me' page that he loves indian food, and, secondly, its his birthday on nov 1st !",

    "description": "i finally mastered pizza making at home! it was a day to celebrate, since this pizza is actually better than you often go out for. when i make this my husband says it's always the best part of his day. it's a combination of recipes and techniques that i put together from cook's illustrated, a very good cook i know, and some \"serious\" pizza guys. this recipe makes a 13x18 inch half-sheet size medium crust pizza, or two traditional round thin crust pizzas, and the crust is crispy/tender. (i find i can get a thinner crust from a round pizza, since there's a little more room to spread the dough out.) the sauce is very flavorful and i've tried to include all my tips for success! you must have a pizza stone for this, and pulling the pizza on the parchment onto an upside-down half sheet pan makes it easy to transfer the pizza to the stone. the sauce recipe will make enough for 3 medium pizzas, or 6 thin crust pizzas, so reserve the extra for another pie. layers for the topping need to be thin enough to allow the crust to crisp. (i know it goes against all instinct, but it's very important to please practice restraint!) i've revised the recipe to include a little less of the toppings for better success. preparation time includes rising time for the dough and may seem like a little work, but once you've tried this you may never go out for pizza again!",

    "description": "ajiaco is a cuban stew consisting of different indiginous root vegetables. it is incredibly tasty and nutritious. a native dish that symbolizes who cubans are as a people and how diverse their ethnic backgrounds came to be formed. according to famed cuban scholar fernando ortiz, the amerindians gave us the maiz (corn), papa(potato), malanga (arum), boniato(sweet potato), yuca (cassava),and aji(pepper). the spaniards added calabaza(pumpkin) and nabo (turnip), while the chinese added spices. the africans contributed name(yams). he says, that cubans are \" a mestizaje(mixture) of kitchens, a mestisaje of races, a mestisaje of cultures, a dense broth of civilization that bubbles on the stove of the caribbean.\" the cuban ajiaco retains the unique flavors of its diverse ingredients, which enrich one another. some ingredients may dissolve completely, while others may remain more distinct. yet all provide flavor to this hearty simmering stew, which by its very nature is always in a state of flux. the cuts of meat all have something in common aside from being \"cuban-style-cut\" they are cheaper cuts, as this is the dish of the \"common man.\" i have used many sources to come up with this recipe for you, from books published in 1925 to ones that i found on the internet. also, used a taste of cuba recipe by sonia martinez, from el asere.com.,ms ramona v. abella's \"the cuban food fairy\", and srta maria antonieta reyes gavilan y moenk's \"delicias del la mesa - manual de cocina y reposteria\". all you need with this dish is some good cuban bread, a french baguette or even foccaccia and some sliced fresh fruit, if you aren't too stuffed by this point! cuban food is highly seasoned but never hot! the ajiaco is/was made every saturday(before castro)and was served as a noon meal which would have a longer lasting effect and in the evening they would have something light. this is very good and appetizing. hope you will enjoy!",

    "description": "from the www.kingarthurflour.com website. if you refer to the website, there are step-by-step instructions that include pictures that could prove very helpful! \"ah, panettone! that ubiquitous (at christmas) sweet bread of milan, golden, high-rising, studded with citron and citrus peel - yuck! if that's your reaction, it's probably because a) you haven't had a good panettone, made the traditional way with a starter, or b) you just don't like citron and candied peel. if this reaction (and its possible causes) is yours, read on. we often use a biga (overnight starter) when making ciabatta or other italian loaves; we feel it helps bring out the wheat flavor in breads that might otherwise seem a bit plain. but in a sweet bread, loaded with sugar, butter and fruit - who needs a biga? well, as it turns out, panettone made with a biga has a moist, fine texture, and rises better than anything with that amount of sugar and fat has a right to. though the dough still needs a big kick of instant yeast, the biga gives it the strength to take off and rise, despite the sugar and fat doing their best to retard the whole process. and as for the fruit: our version uses our favorite combination of dried fruits: no citron, no peel. and, instead of the traditional tall, round loaf pan, which often results in a raw center and burned crust, we suggest the use of a tube or monkey bread pan, such as we use here.\"",

    "description": "this is as wicked as it sounds. a truly delectable combination of flavours and textures that are light and melt in the mouth. i would choose this as a christmas or new year dinner party dessert, as the puddings freeze well and are no trouble to re-heat. a modern british classic - sticky toffee pudding was thought to have originated from the sharrow bay hotel in ullswater in the lake district of northern england there is also a school of thought that john tovey at miller howe in windermere was the first to make this. either way, the pudding is as iconic today as it was when it was first baked and devoured by the lucky diners of either one of those hotels! my recipe is based on the recipe that delia smith published in her christmas cookbook, but i have made several changes that i feel work better for me, the main change is to increase the pecan toffee sauce quantities, as i have had grown people - mainly males - fighting over who gets the last dribble of this delectable sauce!! i hope you find the step-by-step photos useful when you make this for the first time. (this was featured in the september 2008 cooking school topic of the month on zaar - a wonderful event where lots of talented chefs on zaar showed off their culinary skills through photographic tutorials!) prep time includes the time needed for soaking the dates.",

    "full_text": "absolutely sinful sticky toffee pudding with pecan toffee sauce this is as wicked as it sounds. a truly delectable combination of flavours and textures that are light and melt in the mouth. i would choose this as a christmas or new year dinner party dessert, as the puddings freeze well and are no trouble to re-heat. a modern british classic - sticky toffee pudding was thought to have originated from the sharrow bay hotel in ullswater in the lake district of northern england there is also a school of thought that john tovey at miller howe in windermere was the first to make this. either way, the pudding is as iconic today as it was when it was first baked and devoured by the lucky diners of either one of those hotels! my recipe is based on the recipe that delia smith published in her christmas cookbook, but i have made several changes that i feel work better for me, the main change is to increase the pecan toffee sauce quantities, as i have had grown people - mainly males - fighting over who gets the last dribble of this delectable sauce!! i hope you find the step-by-step photos useful when you make this for the first time. (this was featured in the september 2008 cooking school topic of the month on zaar - a wonderful event where lots of talented chefs on zaar showed off their culinary skills through photographic tutorials!) prep time includes the time needed for soaking the dates. butter soft brown sugar eggs self-raising flour dates boiling water vanilla essence instant coffee granules bicarbonate of soda double cream pecan nuts heat the oven to 180c / 360f lightly butter 8 x 3\" ramekin dishes i like to spray them to coat them evenly soak the dates in the boiling water for about half an hour to soften them add the bicarbonate of soda , vanilla essence and coffee mixture , mix well and allow to soak for 30 minutes more in a separate bowl , beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy , then add the beaten eggs , a little at a time , and beat well after each addition fold in the sifted flour , again a little at a time , gently mixing through after each addition then add the date mixture you should have a fairly sloppy mixture , it looks all wrong - but it is all right , i promise you ! divide the mixture equally between the ramekins , place them on a baking tray and bake for 25 to 30 minutes , or until well risen cool for 5 minutes , then loosen them around the sides with a butter knife and turn out the puddings can be cooled and frozen at this stage after freezing , defrost , pour the hot sauce over and re-heat to serve as instructed below to serve:- place the puddings in a shallow ovenproof dish heat the grill make the sauce by melting the butter , cream , pecans and sugar together in a pan , and stir well when just boiling , pour half of the sauce over the puddings and then continue to heat the sauce on a rolling boil until it has thickened place the puddings 5\" below the grill and cook for about 8 minutes , making sure that the nuts and sauce does not burn too badly you should have toasted nuts in places , with a sticky toffee glaze which is almost crunchy serve with the extra toffee sauce in a heatproof jug , chilled cream , custard , ice-cream , or just naked ! time-to-make course main-ingredient cuisine preparation occasion desserts eggs-dairy fruit european dinner-party heirloom-historical holiday-event kid-friendly vegetarian cakes puddings-and-mousses english scottish nuts eggs dietary christmas welsh comfort-food oamc-freezer-make-ahead pitted-fruit taste-mood number-of-servings presentation served-hot 4-hours-or-less"

    "full_text": "amazing stuffing from scratch breadmaker recommended this is the best stuffing ever. even my picky inlaws love it. this recipe takes some planning but all of the prep work can be done well ahead of time. i make the bread, then combine all the ingredients except broth, then freeze it in a foil baking dish. next i freeze the broth in muffin tins and when it's solid, i toss it on top of the frozen stuffing. come the holidays, i pop the whole thing straight from the freezer into the oven. prep time does not include baking the bread. milk salt butter white flour whole wheat flour sugar active dry yeast fresh coarse ground black pepper thyme rosemary sage savory parsley poultry seasoning unsalted butter onions celery garlic cloves eggs walnuts chicken broth for the bread- set up your breadmaker for a 2 pound loaf on the wheat setting and follow your breadmaker's instructions on what order to add ingredients if it's different from my order combine milk , 1 5 tsp salt , 2 tbs butter and put in breadmaker combine both flours , sugar , pepper , thyme , rosemary , sage , savory , parsley , and poultry seasoning mix well add dry mixture to breadmaker add yeast to breadmaker bake on the \"whole wheat\" setting for a 2 pound loaf when finished , remove bread promptly and let cool preheat oven to 200f if you have a convection setting use it chop up bread into 1\" chunks and spread them out on a baking sheet lightly toast the bread chunks in the oven until dry , turning them several times as needed you want them to be dry but not crunchy this takes 20-30 minutes alternatively , you can let them sit on the counter under a towel for 24 hours until stale instead of toasting for the stuffing part: in a large skillet , melt the 3 / 4 cup of butter add onions and celery saute for 3 to 5 minutes until they start to turn translucent add garlic , saute for another 2 to 3 minutes remove from heat add walnuts and mix well place bread chunks into a large bowl add vegetable mixture , eggs , 2 teaspoons salt mix well butter a casserole dish- i use a 12 x 15 but whatever you have that will fit the stuffing is fine remember you can serve the stuffing straight from this dish , so use something pretty if you want directions for baking right away: add 1 cup of broth now and mix well again , then continue adding broth until the stuffing looks moist i use at least 4 cups it will dry out some in the oven so don't skimp put the whole thing in the buttered dish cover with foil directions to freeze for later: , put the bread mixture into the buttered dish , cover with foil , and put it in the freezer get out a 12-cup muffin tin and pour your broth evenly into all the cups stick in the freezer until frozen solid by this time your bread mixture is also frozen place the 12 frozen rounds of broth into the pan , re-cover , stick back in the freezer it will freeze just fine for at least a month , probably longer directions for baking: preheat oven to 350f bake , covered , for 45 minutes until heated through you may need to add 10 minutes if you froze the mixture remove foil , stir gently bake , uncovered , another 15 minutes until golden brown serve warm , with gravy time-to-make course main-ingredient cuisine preparation occasion north-american stuffings-dressings side-dishes vegetables american oven bread-machine holiday-event vegetarian dietary christmas thanksgiving comfort-food oamc-freezer-make-ahead onions taste-mood savory equipment small-appliance number-of-servings presentation served-hot 4-hours-or-less"

      "hopefully i will be able to give you each your first lot of sweet sourdough starter for amish bread as well as sourdough dough starter for sourdough bread , but just in case something happens where i can't for whatever reason , amish bread starter is made with 1 1 / 2 cup each all purpose flour , sugar and milk plus 1 package of dry yeast",
      "lumps aren't really an issue because they break down as the starter ferments",
      "stir daily and feed every 3-4 days",
      "you will probably want to let it have a couple of feedings before you make your first batch of amish bread so you have enough starter",
      "you can feed it as much as you like as long as it's all equal ammounts of milk , flour and sugar",
      "the more often you bake , the more you feed it because you need 3 cups of starter per recipe with enough left over to feed and get going again",
      "i normally feed anywhere between 1 / 2 cup to 1 1 / 2 cup each depending on how much i am baking",
      "i keep my starter on the counter in a plastic half gallon screw top jar i got from the dollar store that i drilled a little hole in the top of",
      "you must have some way to let out the gasses that build up durring fermentation or it will quite literally explode and that makes one horrible mess",

      "you can use a wooden spoon to do it by hand if you really want to however i don't recomend it as it is a huge pain in the part you sit down on when you can grab a hand mixer and have it done in something like 3 minutes",
      "just mix till it's a nice smooth batter",
      "pour the batter evenly into the two pans and sprinkle the remaining sugar mixture over the top",

    "full_text": "amis s christmas stollen pronounced shtoh-luhn, stollen is a wonderful traditional christmas bread from germany. the traditional shape is that of a large, folded oval. every year my grandmother would make this for christmas and we would have it for a light breakfast on christmas morning to tide us over until the feasting started. in my family it's just not christmas without the smell of stollen baking throughout the house. and i love making this and presenting it as gifts as well. my grandmother originally got this from the 1963 better homes and gardens bread cook book. last year she passed the tradition down to me (in other words, if i didn't make it it's not getting done :d) and i added some spices as well as some dates and figs. this can be a bit involved since the total time for rising is 2 hours 40 minutes but it's definitely worth it. note: this does call for almonds. zaar world tour 05 active dry yeast water milk butter sugar salt cardamom allspice ground cloves cinnamon all-purpose flour egg dates currants mixed candied fruit candied cherry blanched almond figs seedless raisin confectioners' sugar hot water stollen: combine the yeast with warm water combine the milk , butter , sugar , salt and cardamom cool to lukewarm stir in 2 c of flour beat well add the softened yeast and egg beat well stir in the fruits , peels and nuts add enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough turn out on a slightly floured surface knead for about 8-10 minutes , or until smooth and elastic place in a greased bowl , turning once to grease the entire surface of the the dough cover and let rise in a warm place for about 1 1 / 2 hours , or until double punch down turn out on a lightly floured surface divide into 3 equal parts cover and let rest for 10 minutes roll each of the 3 sections into a 10 x 16 inch rectangle without stretching , fold the long side over to within 1 inch of the opposite side seal the edge place on a greased baking sheet cover and let rise in a warm place for about 1 hour , or until almost double again preheat the oven to 375 and bake for 15 - 20 minutes or until golden brown let cool slightly and place onto large pieces of wax paper , plastic wrap , platters , etc , each loaf on it's own separate surface you don't want to get the glaze everywhere glaze: my family doubled it because of our huge sweet tooth combine the sugar , water and the butter brush or pour over the stollen it will be runny at first so you may have to spoon any that gooped onto your platter or counter back up onto the loaf you can leave it as it is or decorate it however you wish i always make pretty flowers out of bits of fruit and cherries or sliced almonds such as a flower made with slices of almonds for the petals , bits of candied cherries for the center and citron or green candied cherries for the leaves and stems very pretty let the loaves sit until the glaze has set and then wrap in plastic wrap to keep them fresh until it's time to serve them that's another reason we add so much glaze since it helps keep the bread moist place the loaves in a cool dark place or they even freeze well i put the serving size at 24 , which would be 8 generous slices per loaf but you will probably get more out of it time-to-make course main-ingredient cuisine preparation occasion for-large-groups breads german european dinner-party holiday-event kid-friendly dietary gifts christmas pasta-rice-and-grains brunch number-of-servings 4-hours-or-less"

    "full_text": "2bleu s country ham bacon and eggs here's how to turn that salt cured ham into a delicious breakfast bacon. do not use the ham slice you find in the refrigerated section of your grocery store. you can however, use leftover bone-in baked ham as even the smallest pieces will taste so good (nibblers). a cast iron skillet works best for a true country breakfast. the eggs are optional for this recipe, but if you have never slow cooked your eggs, or never tried them with garlic powder, it's a real treat! leftover ham is great to chop up and use in green beans or collard greens for dinner. ham steaks water vegetable oil butter eggs kosher salt garlic powder black pepper cut the ham slices into about 3\" pieces , removing the bone if it has one the pieces do not have to be cut even , as i usually separate around the fat , leaving some fat for flavor cured ham only: place the salt cured ham slices in a large cast iron pan and add the water , enough to cover the ham slices completely the water may cook down some , so add more as you go as this removes the saltiness from the ham the more water in the pan , the better cook over med heat to a gentle simmer for about 10-15 minutes until most of the salt has dissipated into the water , turning the ham a few times to 'shake the salt out' remove ham slices and rinse and wipe the skillet with a clean dishcloth just a quick rinse / wipe to remove any salt and residue for both types of ham: place pan back on stove-top at a medium heat add the oil to the pan followed by the ham slices lay them in a single layer enough to fill pan but not overcrowd them do in batches if necessary cook for about 10-20 minutes depending on thickness , turning occasionally until browned drain ham onto paper towels add more oil to the pan if necessary for the next batch , although the ham will usually make it's own in the pan from the previous batch you only need enough to cover the bottom of the pan eggs: to a nonstick skillet , melt butter over medium-low heat beat eggs and seasonings until very well blended when butter has melted , pour in the eggs as they begin to firm , push them around a bit using a spatula continue cooking eggs low and slow while ham is cooking in the iron skillet the ham should be done first , just place a piece of foil over top to keep warm when the eggs are about a minute from your desired doneness , place onto plates and serve with ham ham time-to-make course main-ingredient cuisine preparation north-american for-1-or-2 very-low-carbs breakfast eggs-dairy pork american southern-united-states dietary low-calorie low-carb low-in-something meat number-of-servings 4-hours-or-less"

    "full_text": "aluminum football roast turkey i got this method for cooking a turkey off the internet a few years back. it's fool proof, and you'll have the most moist bird ever. you'll also have about a gallon of drippings for stuffing and gravy. i always cook two birds for thanksgiving. one either smoked or fried, and the other this way. the smoked or fried bird goes to the table whole for carving. the bird cook this way is sliced up and brought to the table ready to eat. this is because the bird, while very moist and tasty, is not very attractive due to the fact it won't be very brown and the meat will literally be falling off the bone. the purpose of this posting is not to tell you how to prepare a turkey. do it how ever you usually do. this posting is more about how to cook the bird. once you have popped the bird in the oven, you’re done—no checking, turning, or basting necessary. go do other things. turkey salt pepper olive oil prepare the bird for cooking i generally inject the meat with a store bought herb-butter marinade , then salt and pepper inside and out i recommend not stuffing the bird using heavy duty aluminum foil , the wide kind , lay out a sheet on a flat surface cover the sheet with a thin layer of olive oil place the bird in the middle of the sheet and fold the foil up over the bird pressing / molding the foil to the shape of the bird make sure the top edges of the foil are tucked inside the bottom edges lay out another sheet and cover with oil just like before rotate the bird 90 degrees and place the bird in the center of the new sheet fold over and mold into shape continue this process , rotating and molding as you go after the first two sheets , you don't have to use anymore oil do this for at least seven layers you should end up with a turkey shaped \"aluminum football\" roast at 475 degrees for 4 hours if you've done this properly , you won't be able to even smell the turkey cooking when time is up , bring turkey out and start cutting and peeling back the foil have a turkey baster handy and start transferring the drippings to another container you'll get a lot of drippings once you've gotten the bird uncovered , check for doneness with a meat thermometer i've never had to put the bird back in--it's always been done , but if necessary return to the oven and cook till done once you've freed the bird from the foil , set aside for 15 minutes then slice it all up and put the juicy meat on a platter and serve use the drippings for dressing or gravy time-to-make main-ingredient preparation for-large-groups 5-ingredients-or-less poultry easy turkey dietary meat whole-turkey number-of-servings"

    "description": "i adore moules, mussels, and this is the classic french recipe for them. moules marinières is also commonly known as sailor's mussels or mariner's mussels. the dish consists of delicately steamed fresh mussels in a white wine, garlic, parsley, butter, onion and cream sauce. moules marinières can be served as an appetising starter or even a light main meal. it is delicious served with fresh crusty bread or with frites (chips/fries). there is nothing more mouth-watering than a huge bowl of artistically presented mussels, yet the fun part is eating them. the best way is to use an empty mussel shell as the \"spoon\" in which to pick the remaining mussels from their shells and then eat them. it's a brilliant excuse to use your fingers to eat rather than the usual knife and for - very tactile! a traditional french recipe will use butter, however the butter may be substituted for a few tablespoons of olive oil for a healthier option - i sometimes use a mix of butter and olive oil i hope you find the step-by-step photos helpful, this recipe was used in the september 2008 cooking school for the totm - hopefully, the photos will debunk the myth that mussels are hard to prepare and cook, not so! bon appétit!",
